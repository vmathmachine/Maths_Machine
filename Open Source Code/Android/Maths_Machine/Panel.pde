/*
Panels are a bit different than other Boxes. A panel is composed of 3 components: the surface, the window, and the children.
The children are all the components (boxes) which are displayed as part of the panel. The surface acts like a table mat to display all the
children. The window acts as a literal window from which you can view part of the surface. The surface is at least as large as the window, and
can be moved (scrolled) around freely. Meanwhile, only the parts of the surface which are visible through the window are actually displayed.

All the attributes inherited from box apply to the window. fill is false by default, but you can set it to true to cover up the surface. Or, if fillColor is partially transparent, you can use it
to give you a tinted window.

There are also some attributes which were created solely for describing the surface. Namely its position WRT the window, its dimensions, and its background fill
